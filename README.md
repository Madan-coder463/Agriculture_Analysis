# ðŸŒ¾ Agriculture Analysis by Season Dashboard (Kharif, Rabi, Zaid)

Iâ€™ve developed a Tableau dashboard to analyze agriculture across the Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid seasons. This dashboard provides valuable insights into seasonal crop patterns, production trends, and regional variances, which are essential for understanding and optimizing agricultural output.

## Key Insights:
- **Seasonal Trends**: Analyze how different crops perform across Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid seasons.
- **Regional Analysis**: Identify the key regions for each season's crops and spot trends over time.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Empower stakeholders to make informed decisions for sustainable and efficient agriculture.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, and letâ€™s collaborate to drive innovation in agriculture with data!
